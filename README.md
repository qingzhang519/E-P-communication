# E-P-communication
To simulate various scenarios of enhancer(E)-promoter(P) communication mediated by transcriptional condensates, we model the E-P chromatin region as a polymer chain undergoing self-avoiding walk (SAW) within defined spatial confinements. Here, we present simulation code for SAW-based modeling of different Eâ€“P communication scenarios.
