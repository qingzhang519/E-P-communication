# E-P-communication
To simulate various scenarios of enhancer(E)-promoter(P) communication mediated by transcriptional condensates, we model the E-P chromatin region as a polymer chain undergoing self-avoiding walk (SAW) within defined spatial confinements. Here, we present simulation code for SAW-based modeling of different Eâ€“P communication scenarios.
- "SAW_pivot_3D.py" contains the Python code for simulating the 3D SAW model
- "SAW_pivot_2D.py" contains the Python code for simulating the 2D SAW model
- "SAW_pivot_spherical_surface.py" contains the Python code for simulating the SAW model on a spherical surface              
- "SAW_pivot_spherical_interior.py" contains the Python code for simulating the SAW model on a spherical interior
- "Walk_analysis.py" contains the Python code for analyzing the SAW trajectory of the polymer chain and saving data such as contour length and average end-to-end distance (EED). Note that the figures included are for testing purposes.
